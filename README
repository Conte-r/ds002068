This is the functional and structural MRI data used for the following two studies:

Cross-Task Contributions of Frontobasal Ganglia Circuitry in Response Inhibition and Conflict-Induced Slowing. Cerebral Cortex, Volume 29, Issue 5, Pages 1969â€“1983, https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy076.

Jahfari, S., Theeuwes, J., Knapen, T. (2019). Learning in visual regions as support for the bias in future value-driven choice. bioRxiv, 523340.


Folders are organised in subject number (e.g. sub-01). Within each folder there are subfolders with the following:

1) anat - T1-weighted structural scan

2) func - contains BOLD for: 
- Probabilistic selection task (using faces ), with a learning phase and test phase. Both the learning phase and test phase have 3 scans.
- Stop-signal task using an auditory beep as stop-signal, and faces as go stimuli.
- a PPA, FFA, LO mapper.

3) dwi - 2 diffusion-weighted imaging scans, with corresponding bvec and bval. 

Please note that not all participants finished all tasks, or scans. See papers for a description.
